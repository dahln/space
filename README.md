# Space — AI-assisted Browser Game
***AI Generated README***

A small browser space shooter prototype created with the help of an AI agent and reviewed, designed, and curated by the project owner.

This repository contains a compact, self-contained prototype intended for quick play and experimentation. It was generated by an AI agent given high-level goals and a set of assets; the game design, tuning, and final review were performed by the human maintainer.

## Quick summary
- What: A minimal space shooter prototype (player ship, shooting, simple enemies/asteroids, sound + visuals).
- Where: Core files live under `game/` (notably `game/game.js`, `index.html`, and `style.css`) along with provided SVG and audio assets.
- How it was made: AI-generated code and assets wiring, with human design decisions, testing, and review.

## Run locally

The easiest way to run the game is to open the `index.html` in a modern browser. No build steps or external dependencies are required.

1. Open the project folder.
2. Open `game/index.html` in your browser (drag-and-drop or use `File > Open`).

Notes:
- Some browsers block audio autoplay; interact with the page (click or press a key) to enable sound.
- For best results, use a current version of Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.

## Controls
- Move: Arrow keys or WASD
- Shoot: Spacebar
- Pause: P (if implemented in the prototype)

## Project structure

- `game/`
  - `index.html` — game entry (loads assets and `game.js`)
  - `game/game.js` — main game code (controls, loop, spawn, collisions)
  - `style.css` — simple layout and canvas styling
  - SVGs and audio files — art and sounds used by the prototype (e.g., `ship.svg`, `explosion.svg`, `Explosion.wav`, `Music.mp3`)

## Design & authorship

This prototype is the result of a collaboration between an AI agent and a human designer:

- The AI agent generated the prototype implementation, wiring assets into interactive code and proposing gameplay mechanics.
- The repository owner (human) provided the high-level goals, constraints, iterative feedback, tuning, and final review. All final design and release decisions were made by the human maintainer.

Treat this project as an experiment in creative AI-assisted development: it showcases how an agent can accelerate prototyping while a human ensures alignment, playability, and quality.

## Known limitations & tips
- Prototype-focused: the JavaScript is kept compact for iteration and may not be modularized. Consider refactoring into modules for production use.
- Audio concurrency and timing may need tuning on lower-end devices.
- Playtesting is recommended to adjust difficulty and spawn rates.

## Next steps (suggested)
- Add a short README image or GIF showing gameplay for social sharing.
- Split `game/game.js` into modules for clearer structure and testability.
- Add a small automated smoke test (headless browser) that verifies the game boots.
- Add a credits section for any third-party assets if used.
