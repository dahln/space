                    The Outpost stations were not built to attack. They were watchtowers, carved from old hulls and
                    fitted with defensive turrets to keep a forgotten shipping lane safe. For decades they kept the
                    trail clear — shepherding convoys, relaying distress beacons, and tending to the delicate balance
                    of commerce between the inner colonies and the rim worlds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then the cargo drives started to fail. Shipments of stabilizer ore and coolant arrived late, or
                    not at all. The corporations that funded the Outposts grew hungry for salvage and secrets. Pilots began
                    to vanish near certain waypoints. Rumors spread that a hidden archive had been uncovered: blueprints
                    for a drive modifier that could let a single convoy outrun blockades and taxes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The stations fractured into factions. Some upheld their original mandate — protect and watch. Others
                    sold their turrets to the highest bidder or rewired their targeting logic to hunt anything that
                    carried the old seals. What was once a neutral line of guardians became a gauntlet of suspicion,
                    and then, eventually, a battlefield.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You fly not because you seek glory, but because you fly where the job takes you. The fight is a
                    tangle of contracts, survivors revenge, and corporate hunger. Each station you take down is
                    another node freed from whatever grip has twisted its purpose. Each skirmish is a step toward
                    a passage where ships can travel without fear — or toward the next faction that will claim it.
